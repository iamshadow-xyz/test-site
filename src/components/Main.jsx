          <p>
            So, what exactly is computing? In its simplest form, computing is
            the process of using computers to perform calculations, manage data,
            and solve problems. But it's so much more than that. Computing is at
            the heart of everything we do today, from sending a text message to
            running complex simulations that predict weather patterns.

          <p>
            A computer is a versatile electronic device designed to process data
            and perform a variety of tasks according to a set of instructions,
            known as a program. At its most basic level, a computer takes input,
            processes it, and produces output, often storing the result for
            future use. Computers can execute complex sequences of operations
            automatically and are capable of storing massive amounts of data.

            The term 'Computer' was actually used for people who did
            computations (calculations), and most of computer of the time were
            female employees because they can be paid less than male computers.
